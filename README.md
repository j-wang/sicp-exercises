# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs Exercises
This repo contains my personal solutions and work through the exercises in the SICP book, which is freely available online [here](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).

Exercises are done in Racket, which is basically renamed PLT Scheme.
I may go back and do these in Clojure for practice.
